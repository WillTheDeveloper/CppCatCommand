# C++ "cat" command

Part of a coding challenge

At the moment, the program only executes with a hard-coded file but in the future this will be changed to a parameter when executing the script.

## Features

- Line count
- Identifies the programming language
- ~~Syntax highlighting~~ *(Work in progress)*
- Shows each line number

## How to run

1. Open a terminal in the root of the directory for this project.
2. Compile the code:

```shell
g++ main.cpp src/headers/color.h src/headers/language.h
```

3. If there is no compile errors then it will return nothing and create a file.
4. Run the code (Enter this and press enter key):

```shell
./a.out
```

## Explanation of the "cat" command

The "cat" command originates from Linux where you are able to just read the contents of a file.
